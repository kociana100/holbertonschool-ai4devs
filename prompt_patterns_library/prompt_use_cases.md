  - **Goal**: Summarize changes clearly for users and stakeholders  
  - **Input**: PR description, commit summary, or list of changes  
  - **Output**: Release notes with highlights, breaking changes, and migration notes  

## Testing
- **Unit Test Authoring**
  - **Goal**: Add targeted tests that lock in expected behavior and prevent regressions  
  - **Input**: Function/module code + expected behavior + edge cases  
  - **Output**: Unit tests (framework-specific) + explanation of coverage and gaps  

- **Test Failure Explanation**
  - **Goal**: Explain why a test failed and how to fix code or test correctly  
  - **Input**: Failing test output + relevant code + recent changes  
  - **Output**: Failure analysis + fix options + recommended next test to run  

- **Mocking & Test Doubles Setup**
  - **Goal**: Make code testable by isolating external dependencies (DB, network, clock)  
  - **Input**: Code that calls external services + desired test behavior  
  - **Output**: Mock/stub strategy + example tests + suggested refactor for dependency injection  

## Architecture & Design
